REFUND POLICY 

All sales are final and are made towards the server and go towards overall product cost and maintenance, 
things like keeping the product running and up to date. With this being said, all sales are therefore 
non-refundable unless approved by heaven (Discord: @heavenzone.).  Any attempt of a chargeback will lead to a 
Permanent Blacklist from CELESTIAL, with your goods removed or re-sold. By purchasing anything from our store, 
you are agreeing to our no-refund policy and terms and conditions.
